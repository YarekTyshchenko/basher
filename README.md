# basher

A package manager for shell scripts and functions.

Basher allows you to quickly install shell packages directly from github (or
other sites). Instead of looking for specific install instructions for each
package and messing with your path, basher will create a central location for
all packages and manage their binaries for you.

Even though it is called basher, it also works with zsh and fish.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/basherpm/basher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/basherpm/basher)

## Installation

1. Checkout basher on `~/.basher`

    ~~~ sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/yarektyshchenko/basher.git ~/.basher
    ~~~

2. Add `~/.basher/bin` to `$PATH` for easy access to the basher command-line utility.

    ~~~ sh
    $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.basher/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ~~~

    **Ubuntu Desktop note**: Modify your `~/.bashrc` instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

    **Zsh note**: Modify your `~/.zshrc` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

    **For Fish**: Add the following to you `~/.config/fish/config.fish`

    ~~~ sh
    if test -d ~/.basher
      set basher ~/.basher/bin
    end
    set -gx PATH $basher $PATH
    ~~~

3. Add `basher init` to your shell to enable basher runtime functions

    ~~~ sh
    $ echo 'eval "$(basher init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ~~~

    _Same as in previous step, use `~/.bashrc` on Ubuntu, `~/.zshrc` for Zsh._

    _For **Fish**, use the following line on your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`._

    ~~~ sh
    status --is-interactive; and . (basher init -|psub)
    ~~~

## Updating

Run `basher update` to update basher.

## Usage

### Installing packages from github.com

~~~ sh
$ basher install sstephenson/bats
~~~

This will install bats from https://github.com/sstephenson/bats and add `bin/bats` to the PATH.

### Installing packges from other sites

~~~ sh
$ basher install bitbucket.org/user/repo_name
~~~

This will install `repo_name` from https://bitbucket.org/user/repo_name

### Using ssh instead of https

If you want to do local development on installed packages and you have ssh
access to the site, use `--ssh` to override the protocol:

~~~ sh
$ basher install --ssh juanibiapina/gg
~~~

### Command summary

- `basher commands` - List commands
- `basher help <command>` - Display help for a command
- `basher uninstall <package>` - Uninstall a package
- `basher update` - Update basher to latest version from master
- `basher list` - List installed packages
- `basher outdated` - List packages which are not in the latest version
- `basher upgrade <package>` - Upgrade a package to the latest version

### Configuration options

To change the behavior of basher, you can set the following variables either
globally or before each command:

- `BASHER_FULL_CLONE=true` - Clones the full repo history instead of only the last commit (useful for package development)

## Packages

Packages are simply repos (username/repo). You may also specify a site
(site/username/repo).

Any files inside a bin directory are added to the path. If there is no bin
directory, any executable files in the package root are added to the path.

Any manpages (files ended in `\.[0-9]`) inside a `man` directory are added
to the manpath.

Optionally, a repo might contain a `package.sh` file which specifies binaries,
dependencies and completions in the following format:

~~~ sh
BINS=folder/file1:folder/file2.sh
DEPS=user1/repo1:user2/repo2
BASH_COMPLETIONS=completions/package
ZSH_COMPLETIONS=completions/_package
~~~

BINS specified in this fashion have higher precedence then the inference rules
above.
